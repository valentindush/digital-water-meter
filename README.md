# Digital Water Meter

This project is a digital water meter that utilizes computer vision to read and monitor water consumption. It is designed to provide an accurate and automated method of measuring water usage in real-time.

## Features

- **Computer Vision:** The meter uses computer vision algorithms to analyze video footage and detect the water meter readings.
- **Real-time Monitoring:** The system provides real-time monitoring of water consumption, allowing users to track their usage and identify any anomalies.
- **Data Visualization:** The collected data is visualized using graphs and charts, making it easier to understand and analyze water consumption patterns.
- **Alerts and Notifications:** The system can send alerts and notifications to users when certain thresholds or anomalies are detected, helping to prevent water wastage or leaks.
